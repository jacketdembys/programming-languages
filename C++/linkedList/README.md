# Linked List:

A linked list is a data structure that is helpful to store several elements referred to as nodes. The stored elements or nodes are connected via pointers.

The node is made of two parts: 
* data (part containing the stored data)
* next (part containing the address of the next node, hence establishing the link between nodes).

In the linked list, the first node is called head node and the last node is called tail node. 

There are two types of linked list:
* Singly-linked list: every node contains some data and a link to the next node in the list
* Doubly-linked list: every node contains some data, a link to the next node and a link to the previous node

To test this code, please download the entire folder and run on the command line:
```
$ make all
$ ./mainLinkedList

```
